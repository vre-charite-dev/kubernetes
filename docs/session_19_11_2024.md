```sql
SELECT 'CREATE USER ${KEYCLOAK_SERVER_USERNAME}' WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_roles WHERE rolname = '${KEYCLOAK_SERVER_USERNAME}')\gexec
                ALTER USER ${KEYCLOAK_SERVER_USERNAME} WITH PASSWORD '${KEYCLOAK_SERVER_PASSWORD}';
                GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ${KEYCLOAK_DB_NAME} TO ${KEYCLOAK_SERVER_USERNAME};
                GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ${KEYCLOAK_DB_NAME} TO postgres;
                \connect ${KEYCLOAK_DB_NAME}
                GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO ${KEYCLOAK_SERVER_USERNAME};
